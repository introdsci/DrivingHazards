Let's look into the `Seatbelts` built-in data set to explore information about driving hazards. First, I am loading the data set into a table and converting the `law` variable into a logical type (`TRUE` or `FALSE`) instead of a numeric (`0` or `1`) value.

```{r}
library("dplyr")
library("tidyr")
library("caret")

driving <- as_tibble(Seatbelts)
driving$law <- as.logical(driving$law)
```

But let's also look at the total number of people killed (not separated by seat).

```{r}
driving$totalKilled <- driving$DriversKilled+driving$front+driving$rear
```

Finally, let's explore what variables help us predict the number of deaths due to car accidents.

```{r}
driving_model <- lm(data=driving, formula=totalKilled~drivers+kms+PetrolPrice+law)
summary(driving_model)
```
